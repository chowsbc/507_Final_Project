def create_private_pie(county_name):
    '''Queries birds.sqlite for the numbers of recent bird sightings on private and on public property in a county. Creates a pie chart.

    Uses county_name to create two queries to the sqlite database specified by the global variable "DB_NAME" (bird.sqlite).
    One query returns a list of one tuple with the number of recent bird sightings on public property. The other
    query returns a list of one tuple with the number of recent bird sightings on private property. Uses Plotly to make
    a pie chart with the percentage of bird sightings on public and on private property and opens them in the user's browser.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    county_name: string
        The name of a county.

    Returns:
    --------
    None (but creates a Plotly infogrpahic and opens it in the user's browser.)

    From species_page_data_, parses the order, family, genus, and status (eg. "endangered"), of a bird that was sighted,
    as well as the address that it was sighted at. Uses Plotly to create a table that displays this information.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    species_page_data: dictionary
        Contains key value pairs representing a bird specie's status, and its taxonomic classification. Also has an image url.

    address: string
        A string representing the address of a bird siting that the user has queried.
